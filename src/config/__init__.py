# __init__.py
# This file is used to define the package structure and initialize the package. It is also used to import modules into the package namespace. 
# In this case, the __init__.py file is used to import settings from the settings module into the config package namespace. This allows other 
# modules within the package to access the settings without having to import them directly.
